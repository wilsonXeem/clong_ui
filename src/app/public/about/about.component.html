      <h2 class="section-title">The Burden behind CloNG Project Int'l</h2>
      <p>
        In April 2014, during my internship as a Pharmacist, the Lord placed
        on me the burden for the next generation leadership. It was borne out
        of prayer and passion to see men and women that will be clothed with
        the PRINCIPLES AND THE PRESENCE of God. The next generation of leaders
        that will stand out on the mountain of education and beyond shall be
        men that know HIS PRINCIPLES and are robed with HIS PRESENCE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three years later, on April 19th, 2017, at the place of prayer, the
        Lord showed me a nest of golden eggs without a mother hen. It got me
        bewildered as to why there will be nest of eggs but no mother hen to
        incubate them. As I pondered on the vulnerability of these golden eggs
        to waste and destruction, I saw flood light from Heaven shine upon the
        nest. Then He said to me, THE GOLDEN EGGS represent the NEXT
        GENERATION OF LEADERS, THE NEST signifies CloNG-Project platform while
        THE LIGHT from Heaven is THE SUPERNATURAL PRESENCE and PRINCIPLES OF
        GOD.
      </p>
      <p>
        CloNG project is the nest that will nurture and provide a platform for
        the LIGHT of God's Presence and Principles to incubate the Next
        generation of Leaders that will excellently represent God in all
        fields of endeavour.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January 2018, the vision was officially launched while our first
        conference held in February, 2022.
